# Horangi

The 'Horangi' keyboard is an ergonomic, symmetrical split keyboard with a built-in trackball. It utilizes Gateron KS-33 low profile switches and offers the option of hot-swapping. The MCU used is an rp2040 zero, contributing to a relatively small and aesthetically pleasing design. Additionally, it features m2 holes for tenting and supports the use of a trackball with additional parts.

Additionally, the Horangi features a very unique thumb cluster. It can be attached or detached as needed, and thanks to this special thumb cluster, it allows for the use of arrow keys, which are usually hard to find on typical split keyboards.
