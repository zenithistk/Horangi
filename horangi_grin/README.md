# Horangi_grin

The 'Horangi_grin' keyboard is a fully wireless, ergonomic split keyboard. Inspired by the [Grin layout keyboard](https://kbd.news/Grin-layout-1348.html), this keyboard features a layout similar to a 75% keyboard, making it easy for users accustomed to standard keyboards to adapt to a split keyboard. It can be used separately for each hand or combined as needed, and is designed to be as compact as possible, ensuring both practicality and portability.
